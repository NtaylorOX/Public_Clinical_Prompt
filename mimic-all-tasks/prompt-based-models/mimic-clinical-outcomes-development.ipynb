No urine incontinence or e/o toxidromes. Labs notable for EtOH 86, Osms 366, anion gap 16, lactate 3.8. Utox positive for barbs, but Stox and Utox otherwise negative. Given high serum osmolar gap (60), toxicology was consulted for concern of toxic alcohol ingestion. Most likely isopropyl alcohol given osmolar gap with small anion gap (likely due to lactate) and access to CalStat in the hospital today. However, given a dose of Fomepizole 15mg/kg IVx1 in the ED for possible ethylene glycol vs methanol ingestion. Also given Diazepam 10mg x1 for EtOH withdrawal.

She states the non-bloody/non-billous vomiting started Monday evening as well as the diarrhea. She states she drank a boost that exacerbated this. No fevers. She continued to have this intermittently overnight and awoke Tuesday morning with severe lower and left sided abdominal pain, 15/10, and constant and releived with dilaudid. In the OSH, her blood pressures were noted to be in the 80s with a lactate of 2.4. She was started on ceftriaxone and given 1.5 grams/kg of albumin. On day of transfer, other notable lab findings include a wbc of 19,900, INR: 1.7, and Cr of 2.0 (baseline around 1.5). . Of note, the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2172-11-16**] for acute renal failure due to volume overload, as well as an E. Coli UTI. Her Cr prior to d/c was 1.4. With the question of outflow obstruction vs. rejection in the outpatient a transjugular liver biopsy [**12-12**] was attempted, but failed due to diminutive right hepatic vein. There is also speculation from her Hepatologist that her worsening liver failure is due to recurrent EtOH use, and she admits to resuming EtOH use in the fall. .

Patient had recent long, complicated admission from [**12/2167**] - [**3-/2168**] for HCAP (ESBL E.Coli and MRSA grew in sputum) and sepsis complicated by respiratory failure requiring intubation and later tracheostomy. Patient was treated with vanc and meropenem. She had a BAL that grew aspergillus and was treated with a course of voriconazole. At that time patient had been intubated and later extubated at OSH prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. She had persistent stridor at [**Hospital1 18**] and underwent bronchoscopy showing severe distal tracheal malacia and severe bilateral main bronchi malacia. A tracheostomy was performed on [**1-6**]. Throughout hospitalization, she required intermittent PSV ventilation, but was tolerating trach collar for prolonged periods of time. Patient's course was complicated by multiple pneumothoraces requiring several chest tube placements. She underwent pleurodesis by thoracic surgeons on [**2168-3-15**] and the chest tube was removed. She later had a recurrent pneumothorax requiring a pig tail chest tube. The chest tube was again removed on [**2168-3-24**] and patient did not have any further recurrent pneumonthoraces. Patient was discharged on inhaled colistin to supress any future infections.  Patient was discharged to the MACU at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on [**2168-3-25**]. She had been doing well and had been completely weaned off the ventilator, but since [**2168-6-2**] she has had progressive hypercapnia while off the ventilator. She also became progressively tired and dyspnic off the ventilator. As per [**Hospital1 18**] IP, patient may have recently had trach exchanged for shorter trach; however, this is not documented in [**Hospital **] rehab records. She also has had some cough and increased secretions. As per her daughter she also ate salty soup one week ago and she had worsenign pedal edema and dyspnea. She is admitted for bronchoscopy and likely trach replacement by IP.  On arrival to the MICU, patient is comfortable and her breathing is comfortable. She complains of some slightly worsened peripheral edema, but otherwise no complaints.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: tracheal malacia and severe bilateral main bronchi malacia tracheostomy in [**12/2167**] respiratory failure ESBL E.coli and MRSA pneumonia dCHF EF > 55% DMII (A1c 6.8 [**11/2167**]) Mild Bronchiectasis Anxiety Microcytic Anemia ?Thalassemia Trait Hypertension GERD Hiatal Hernia on EGD [**2161**] s/p Cholecystectomy\\n\\nMEDICATION ON ADMISSION: Medications (List from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab): Acetazolamide 250 mg daily acetylcysteine 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] intratracheal albuterol/ipratropium inhaler 6 puffs QID ammonium chloride 486 mg [**Hospital1 **] j-tube Aspirin 81 mg daily diltiazem 30 mg PO Q8H docusate sodium 100 mg PO BID furosemide 20 mg PO daily Gentamicin sulfate nebulizer 80 mg Q12H Heparin 5000 units Q12H Levetiracetam 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] Niacin 50 mg qAM Quetiapine 25 mg QHS Thiamine 200 mg qAM acetaminophen 650 mg Q6H PRN bacitracin topical ointment 1 application Q6H Levalbuterol 0.63 mg nebs Q2H PRN miconazole nitrate 2% powder 1 application TID PRN sodium chloride 0.65% nasal spray PRN\\n\\nALLERGIES: Ace Inhibitors / Iodine / cefepime\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAM: Exam upon admission:\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY: Her father had COPD and asthma, no other respiratory or cardiac history.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Originally from [**Country 47535**], moved here from [**Country 47535**] [**2166-10-24**].

There, she was found to be in new onset atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure.  An aggressive rate control and diuresis were attempted; however, her condition with regards to her oxygen requirement continued to worsen.  A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which revealed no clot, aortic stenosis, with a valve area of 0.65 cm squared and a valve gradient of approximately 15 mm. Cardioversion was then attempted which required the patient to be intubated due to worsening respiratory distress.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for valvuloplasty and further evaluation and management.  Per outside hospital records, the patient also was febrile with an increased leukocytosis with possible pulmonary infiltrates.

Before admission, pt was being treated for C. diff, with positive assay noted at NH 2 weeks PTA (had a course of PO flagyl but still had diarrhea so was changed to PO vanc). At OSH CT ABD showed pan colitis. Pt was stabilized with IVF digoxin for a fib and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]. At BICMC surgery evaluated and felt the collitis to be most likely infectious. Pt was hypotensive in the ED so went to the MICU. In the MICU PO vanc was continued and PO flagyl was added for C. Diff. BP stabilized to basline of SBP 90-100 with fluid resuscitation - no pressors were required. All cultures negative since admission. C. Diff assay has been negative here, but he has continued to have diarrhea. He was transferred to the floor with stable VS. . On the floor, he has had a worsening polyarticular gout flare. He was restarted on his home colchicine and probenacid with little relief of symptoms. Rheumatology was consulted and recommended a steroid taper, but the floor team decided to hold off on this in the setting of infection. UA was positive after transfer and cipro was started empirically. . On the afternoon after transfer, he triggered for low urine output. This was felt to be due to hypovolemia and he was given 1L of 1/2NS because of concern for hypernatremia. By 10pm he had made ~500cc urine since midnight. He was then hypotensive to mid-80s systolic. At that time he was afebrile and it was felt that hypotension was still most likely due to hypovolemia. He received 500cc NS with good effect (SBP to 100s). Following this he became febrile to 100.8, BP returned to mid-80s systolic. Continue to have very poor urine output. Blood pressure and urine output did not respond to a further 1L of NS. Mental status grossly the same although patient has baseline dementia. Was unable to swallow pills however which is reportedly new. On repeat exam patient was felt to have mild guarding although he denied pain, he did not have rebound tenderness. CXR did not show free air. Given possibility of urosepsis with resistant organism, Cipro was broadened to Zosyn.  With volume resuscitation, patient began to get more edematous in lower extremities and scrotum. He continued to breathe comfortably on room air however O2 saturation went from 99-100% to 94-95%.  On arrival, he was unable to give additional details of history. He denies CP, SOB, orthopnea, PND, cough, abdominal pain, N/V.

Therefore, she was put on NIPPV and transferred to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] where she was intubated with succinylcholine etomidate.  Given pink, frothy secretions from the tube and bilateral fluffy infiltrates presumed etiology was heart failure exacerbation so the patient received 80 mg of IV furosemide and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. En route the patient was hypotensive on propofol, which was discontinued.  On arrival she was agitated and received fentanyl/midazolam for sedation before receiving linezolid and pipercillin-tazobactam due to concern the patient's infiltrates were due to pneumonia. Initial ABG here was 7.23/ 71 / 406 on AC with Tv 450, RR 16, PEEP 5, and 02 100%.   The patient was noted to have high peak pressures (>30) with high plateaus raising concern for auto-PEEP.  Therefore, he received 10 mg IV vercuronium.  He also received an unclear amount of fluid for transient hypotension.  With increasing her minute ventilation pH rose to 7.9 and CO2 dropped to 60.  He was transferred to the MICU.  Of note, the patient had a VERY similar presentation on [**2169-8-5**] in which the patient was admitted for multifocal pneumonia with concern for volume overload.

The patient was treated over several months with antibiotics, for three separate courses, without relief.  Eventually, a repeat chest x-ray showed a right lower lobe infiltrate and the patient was sent to the Emergency Room to be treated for pneumonia.  In the Emergency Room, a CT scan of the chest was obtained and showed dense consolidation in the right lower lobe and right middle lobe with a large loculated right pleural effusion.  The patient was admitted and started on broad spectrum antibiotics, and her pleural effusion was tapped. The pleural fluid obtained was consistent with an empyema, however, the patient underwent bronchoscopy prior to VATS to rule out malignancy.  During the bronchoscopy, a blood vessel was nicked.  During the biopsy, the patient bled acutely, decompensated and had to be intubated.  After intubation, the patient had a tonic-clonic seizure. Subsequently, she underwent a neurological workup.  The seizure was thought to be hypoxic versus toxic metabolic. The patient was loaded on Dilantin and, over the next several days, her neurological status was noticed to be slowly improving.  She required multiple packed red blood cell transfusions.  The patient eventually underwent a VATS with decortication in the Operating Room.  Over the next several days, the patient was difficult to wean from the ventilator.  She subsequently developed a left pleural effusion which was tapped for 800 cc.  She was eventually extubated successfully on hospital day number 18, but had an acute episode of mucus plugging, which led to desaturation and tachycardia.  The patient was ruled out for a pulmonary embolism by CT angiogram and her acute desaturation was resolved with suctioning.

He also reports increase in fatigue and anorexia over the last month with approximately a 10 pound weight loss.  He initially describes the shortness of breath as intermittent and occurring over the last month, however significantly worsened over the last few days.  He denies ever having any chest pain.  He was evaluated by his primary cardiologist and electively admitted for right heart cath.  On [**2153-3-29**], the patient underwent right heart catheterization which showed cardiac output 4.13, cardiac index 2.33, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 46, PA pressure 73/27.  Left heart catheterization was also performed which showed widely patent LIMA to LAD with normal left main, occluded midvessel LAD, midvessel 30% left circumflex lesion, and luminal irregularities in the RCA.  After the cardiac catheterization, he was admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit for tailored CHF management. Secondary to sedation received in the Cardiac Cath Lab and increasing hypercapnia, the patient was electively intubated on [**2153-3-29**].  The patient was extubated on [**2153-3-30**].  However, due to fever to 103, right lower lobe infiltrate and respiratory distress, he was reintubated.  Over the course of the next 4 days, the patient was diuresed with Natrecor for a short period of time, as well as intravenous lasix.  His cardiac output and index progressively improved to a point where his cardiac output was roughly 6, and his index was 3.3.  As his CHF management was felt to be optimized, he was placed no pressure support ventilation on numerous occasions and was not deemed able to be weaned from the ventilator.  He was, therefore, transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further respiratory management and possible tracheostomy.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Congestive heart failure with EF of 20-25%. 2.

Per ED records, he had lethargy at breakfast.  Daughter at that time had denied any recent illnesses, but did endorese a recent change in BP meds. Of note, he was admitted to [**Hospital6 1597**] in [**6-9**] with RLL pneumonia.  Initial [**Hospital1 18**]-N ED VS: T 103.7  HR 104  BP 157/63 RR 22 O2 95%. EKG showed atrial fibrillation at [**Street Address(2) 74875**] depression <1 mm in lateral leads.  CXR reportedly with RLL pneumonia.  Labs notable for hyponatremia of 133, Cr of 1.2, and leukocytosis of 25.9.  For his pneumonia, the patient was started on ceftazidime given history of pseudomonas pneumonia at [**Last Name (un) 1724**]. ID was also consulted, and the patient was switched to Zosyn.  PICC was placed on [**2190-5-3**].  WBC improved to 16, and vancomcyin was empirically started also.  CT chest 2 days prior to transfer showed new R pleural effusion, worsening LUL consolidation and small L pleural effusion with RLL being difficult to assess due to effusion.  Thus, pulmonary was consulted 1 day PTA and thoracentesis was performed. Per Hospitalist, 650 cc of transudative fluid was removed. That evening, his INR was 1.7 and he was given 2 mg coumadin.  The morning of transfer, he complained of the R chest area hurting.  A \\\"fist size\\\" swelling was noted.  CT chest/abdomen/pelvis was completed prior to transfer that showed R chest wall hematoma, moderate to large R pleural effusion, and L moderate pleural effusion. Subsequently, it was found that blood clots were oozing in the R pleural effusion as well.  Per hospitalist, over the next 8 hours, the patient's hematoma grew to the size of \\\"two hands\\\" (10x15 cm) in the setting of Hgb from 11-->8.  INR was 1.6 at that time.  CT surgery was consulted, who recommended OSH ICU transfer for closer monitoring. Per hospitalist, the patient was never hemodynamically unstable with HR in 90-110 (afib) and lowest BP 110.  He is being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] given the possibility of angiogram to embolize a intrathoracic vessel that may have been damaged during thoracentesis.  He was ordered for 1 pRBC transfusion and vitamin K 1 mg SQ was given prior to transfer.  Also during his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**]-N, he was found to be in new atrial fibrillation on admission.  Cardiology consult obtained, which thought afib was due to infection.  He was started on metoprolol 50 mg po BID and started on lovenox and coumadin for anticoagulation.  Atrial fibrillation was reportedly as high as 120-140.  He was also given digoxin.  His coumadin was titrated up but due to INR [**4-7**], this was held for a few days.  He was restarted on coumadin as per above.

An MRI at that time revealed a subdural hematoma on the left side with mass affect and midline shift.  She was seen by Neurosurgery at that time and treated with platelet transfusions and high-dose steroids.  The hematoma was stable in follow-up imaging and the patient was discharged home with close monitoring.  The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] from [**12-17**] until [**2105-12-19**], for increasing left lower extremity pain and weakness.  The plan was to treat this pain with outpatient XRT to the SI joint.  During this admission, the patient received multiple platelet transfusions and was given intravenous IG for two days.  On [**2105-12-23**], the patient presented to the Radiation [**Hospital **] Clinic for XRT planning.  At that time she was complaining of headache and she was noted to be increasingly somnolent and have some gait instability.  Her platelet count was found to be 16,000, therefore, she was admitted and a STAT head CT scan was done due the suspicion of worsening subdural bleed.  The head CT scan showed an increase in the left subdural hematoma with sub-falcine herniation.  The patient was transferred directly to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and was supported with platelet transfusions and intravenous Decadron.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: 1.

Etiology likely hypovolemic in the setting of nausea, vomiting and limited PO intake in days preceding hospitalization. Alternative etiolgies entertained on admission included hypotension secondary to septic shock, secondary to GI bleed. Regarding potential for infection patient afebrile in house with WBC wnl and without complaints of localized infection. GI bleed on presenting differential as pt Guaiac positive on admission, however patients HCT remained stable after dilutional drop. Patient received total of 7L of IVF with improvement in hemodynamics. Nausea resolved quickly after admission and patient able to take in adequate PO prior to discharge. Decision made to hold anti-hypertensives to time of discharge with plan to likely re-implement after post-discharge appt. OUTPATIENT: -- Continue to monitor hemodynamics -- Re-initiate anti-hypertensives at [**Hospital 1944**] clinic after both BP and renal function monitored. . # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure. Baseline creatinine 1.5. Creatinine on Admission 7.5 -> 5.5 ->3.3 in the setting of IVF. Etiology likely pre-renal in setting of decreased PO intake, emesis as function has improved markedly with hydration. Urine lytes: FeNa: 3.4 consistent with pre-renal -> ATN. Patient with adequate urine output throughout stay so low clinical suspicion for obstructive component. At time of discharge, creatinine 1.3; decision made to hold lisinopril and HCTZ until renal function monitored and stabilization ensured. OUTPATIENT ISSUES -- Repeat chemistry 7 as outpatient to monitor renal functino -- Continue to hold lisinopril and HCTZ until repeat lab values obtained.  # Persistent nausea, vomiting. Admission differential diagnosis to Nausea/Vomiting broad with consideration of underlying Cardiac, Neurologic, Hepatic, Gastric, Renal and Pancreatic pathology. After work-up surmised that viral gastroenteritis was likely causative factor for nausea, vomiting. Regarding alternative diagnosis: LFTs wnl, Lipase 66. Patient without overt cardiac history (only RF is HTN, HL), EKG without ischemic changes and though admission Trop elevated it was in setting of creatinine of 7.5. Cerebellar ischemia can manifest as n/v and patient does describe gait unsteadiness but less likely than viral gastroenteritis especially as patients neuro exam is intact. It was possible that ARF preceded emesis and uremia incited nausea/emesis however the fact ARF improved so rapidly with IVF argues against intrinsic or post-renal etiology. During hospitalization, anti-emetics were used as needed; nausea resolved and prior to discharge patient tolerated full diet without nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.  #. Guaiac Positive Stool. On admission to the ED, rectal exam guaiac + with initial concern for UGIB in setting of hypotension. Subsequent NG Lavage negative.
