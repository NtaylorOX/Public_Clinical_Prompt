Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed EF about %. . Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.

She was taken to the catheterization lab where she was found to have no significant CAD, severe MVP and regurgitation with moderate pulmonary hypertension, LVEF %. Given the severity of her disease, the cardiac surgical service was consulted for surgical repair of her valve disease. She was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner including an echocardiogram which revealed trace Aortic insufficiency, + mitral regurgitation with myxomatous leaflets, and an LV ejection fraction of %, RVEF %, bilateral atrial enlargement. On , Ms. was taken to the operating room. She underwent a mitral valve replacement using a mm pericardial model bioprosthesis. Postoperatively she was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. Beta blockade and aspirin were resumed. She was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. On POD Her pressors were weaned, chest tubes were removed, and she was transferred to the cardiac stepdown unit. Beta blockade and aspirin were resumed. She was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. On POD her epicardial wires were removed without incident. The physical therapy service was consulted to assist with her postoperative strength and mobility. Her oxygen saturations improved to % on room air. The physical therapy service was consulted to assist with her postoperative strength and mobility. On POD Ms. was kg above her preop weight with good exercise tolerance, no SOB, or Chest pain. Her blood pressure was stable. Her sternotomy incision was clean, dry, and intact without evidence of infection. She was discharged home on POD with services in good condition, cardiac diet, sternal precautions, and instructed to follow up with her PCP and cardiologist in weeks. She will follow up with Dr. in four weeks. Medications on Admission: Paxil mg qday Discharge Medications: . Furosemide mg Tablet Sig: One ( Tablet PO QH (every hours for days.
